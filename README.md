# MCQ Generator for notes
The use of Natural Language Processing technique can make the tedious task of manually
generating Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) very simple. In the context of education, creating
questions that are applicable to the content is a challenge considering that maintaining the
academic context and quality of the questions is important. In this chapter we have presented
an approach to MCQ generation using the various techniques of Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Using these techniques we have extracted fill-in-the blank questions, along with the
significant keywords (correct answers) pertinent to the context, and distractors (wrong answers)
as the choices. Through this we show a way to use NLP to effectively produce questions and
answers that are both relevant to the context and grammatically comprehensive. The results
of our study can be used to further enhance the potential in using Natural language in different
education domains for the purpose of generating MCQs to improve in terms of educational
assessment and content development
